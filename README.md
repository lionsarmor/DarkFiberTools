   Icon=/path/to/icon.png
   Terminal=true
   Type=Application
   Categories=Utility;
   ```

2. Save this file with a `.desktop` extension (e.g., `DarkFiberTools.desktop`).

3. Make it executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/DarkFiberTools.desktop
   ```

4. Move the `.desktop` file to your Desktop directory:
   ```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Virtual Environment Not Found**:  
  If you are on Windows and the virtual environment does not exist, you can manually create it by running:

  python -m venv venv
  ```

  Then activate it by running:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Dependency Installation Issues**:  
  If the dependencies fail to install during setup, try manually installing them by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
